*FAQ*

Q: How to run on Linux?
A:
* To run it natively, you'll need mono: [[http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html]], and compile the source [[http://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/downloads]].
* The official windows executable (at least 1.1.1.8) also works in wine [[http://www.winehq.org/download/]] with .NET 2.0 installed [[http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=3754]]. In case you got issues you should try binaries inside debug folder before attempting any other steps to sort issue.

Q: How to run on Ubuntu from source?
A:
# download latest source [[http://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/downloads]]
# install some tools: "sudo apt-get monodevelop liblog4net-cil-dev"
# in source directory: "mdtool build"
# run: "./bin/Debug/LOIC.exe"
# Note: ATTENTION to run with arguments, little difference from m$ version.
 “./bin/Debug/LOIC.exe /hivemind irc.server.address 1234 \#secret”. You must add “\” in front of “#”, or linux will think its a comment and it will ignore the rest of the line beyond it.
