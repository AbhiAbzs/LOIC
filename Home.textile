*FAQ*

Q: Running on none mickeysoft OS.
A: To run it natively, you'll need mono: [[http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html]], and compile the source [[http://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/downloads]] . The windows version also works in wine [[http://www.winehq.org/download/]]. In Linux you can try using debug binaries (some users said it worked).

Q:how to install on Ubuntu?
A:
1.download latest source [[http://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/downloads]]
2.install some tools: "sudo apt-get monodevelop liblog4net-cil-dev"
3.in source directory: "mdtool build"
4.run: "./bin/Debug/LOIC.exe"
5.ATTENTION to run with arguments, little difference from m$ version.
“./bin/Debug/LOIC.exe /hivemind irc.server.address 1234 \#secret”. You must add “\” in front of “#”, or linux will think its a comment and it will ignore the rest of the line beyond it.
