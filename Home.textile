*FAQ*
Q: Linux version?
A: You can try compiling it from source ([[http://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/downloads]]) or use debug binaries (some users said it worked).

Q: Linux version: how to install on Ubuntu?
A: I think you need this: [[http://www.mono-project.com/DistroPackages/Ubuntu]] before trying.

Q:Ubuntu installation?
A:
1.download source [[http://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/downloads]]
2.install some tools: "sudo apt-get monodevelop liblog4net-cil-dev"
3.in source directory: "mdtool build"
4.run: "./bin/Debug/LOIC.exe"
5.ATTENTION to run with arguments "./bin/Debug/LOIC.exe /hivemind irc.server.address 1234 \#secret". You must add "\" in front of "#", or linux will think its a comment and it will ignore it.
