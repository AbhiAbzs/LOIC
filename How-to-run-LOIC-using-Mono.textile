*Assuming you have Linux or Mac OS X:*

# Download LOIC (with windows binaries) from download page and extract in desktop.
# Download mono from: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20170103060539/http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html]]
# Install mono.
# Open terminal and type
_mono /path_to_loic/debug/LOIC.exe_
# LOIC should open (check tray too)

Tested in Mac OS X with LOIC v1.1.1.11
