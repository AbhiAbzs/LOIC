ok, since v1.1.2.x is in beta stage and very unstable I decided to delete download package.

TODO:
* Review TCP, UDP and HTTP protocols (probably others too) and implement checks to see if connection failed
* Fix IRC _motd missing, no join_ issue.
* Fix tray icon issue.
* Look at branches here: [[https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/network]] and take useful ideas/code :)
